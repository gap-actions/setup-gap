# setup-gap V3

This GitHub action downloads and prepares an instance of GAP.
It is intended to be used by the Continuous Integration (CI) action of a GAP
package, that is by an action which runs a package's test suite.

## Supported OSes

This action can be run on macOS, Ubuntu and Windows (when preceded by the `setup-cygwin` action).


## Usage

The action `setup-gap` has to be called by the workflow of a GAP
package.
By default it
- downloads and compiles the latest release of GAP, and
- compiles the packages `io`, `json` and `profiling`

Its behaviour can be customized via the inputs below.
